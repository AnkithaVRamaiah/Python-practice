## **🔹 What is a Virtual Environment?**  
A **virtual environment** is like a **separate workspace** for each Python project. It lets you **install project-specific libraries** without affecting other projects or the system's Python installation.  

📌 Think of it like this:  
- You have **two Python projects**:  
  - **Project A** needs `Django 3.2`  
  - **Project B** needs `Django 4.0`  
- If you install both versions on your system, they may conflict.  
- But with **virtual environments**, each project gets its own **isolated Python setup**.  

---

## **🔹 Why Use a Virtual Environment?**  
✅ **Avoid conflicts** – Different projects can use different versions of the same library.  
✅ **Safe testing** – Experiment with packages without breaking system Python.  
✅ **Easy dependency management** – Install only what you need for a project.  

---

## **🔹 How to Create and Use a Virtual Environment?**  

### **1️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment**  
Go to your project folder and run:  
```sh
python -m venv my_env
```
👉 This creates a folder **my_env/**, which contains an **isolated Python environment**.  

---

### **2️⃣ Activate the Virtual Environment**  
Now, you need to activate it:  

📌 **For Windows:**  
```sh
my_env\Scripts\activate
```

📌 **For macOS/Linux:**  
```sh
source my_env/bin/activate
```

✅ **You'll see `(my_env)` in your terminal, meaning it's active.**  

---

### **3️⃣ Install Packages in the Virtual Environment**  
Once activated, install libraries inside this environment:  
```sh
pip install requests
```
👉 Now, `requests` is installed **only inside** `my_env`, not globally.  

Check installed packages:  
```sh
pip list
```

---

### **4️⃣ Deactivate the Virtual Environment**  
To exit the virtual environment, run:  
```sh
deactivate
```
✅ Now, you're back to the system Python.

---

## **🔹 Example: Using Virtual Environment for AWS Boto3**  
Let's use a virtual environment for AWS automation:  

```sh
# Step 1: Create a virtual environment
python -m venv aws_env

# Step 2: Activate it
source aws_env/bin/activate  # (Linux/macOS)
aws_env\Scripts\activate     # (Windows)

# Step 3: Install Boto3 inside the virtual environment
pip install boto3

# Step 4: Write a Python script
```
📄 **aws_script.py**
```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client("s3")
buckets = s3.list_buckets()

for bucket in buckets["Buckets"]:
    print(bucket["Name"])
```

Run the script inside the virtual environment:  
```sh
python aws_script.py
```

✅ **Now, the script runs in an isolated environment** without affecting system Python.

## **🔹 Summary**
| **Command** | **Purpose** |
|------------|------------|
| `python -m venv my_env` | Create a virtual environment |
| `source my_env/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) <br> `my_env\Scripts\activate` (Windows) | Activate the virtual environment |
| `pip install package_name` | Install packages inside the virtual environment |
| `pip list` | List installed packages |
| `deactivate` | Exit the virtual environment |

---

## **🔹 Practice Time!**
Great! Let's go step by step.  

---

## **✅ Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment**  
First, open a terminal (or Command Prompt) and go to your project folder.  

Now, create a virtual environment:  
```sh
python -m venv my_project_env
```
👉 This will create a folder **my_project_env/**, which contains an isolated Python environment.  

---

## **✅ Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment**  

📌 **For Windows:**  
```sh
my_project_env\Scripts\activate
```

📌 **For macOS/Linux:**  
```sh
source my_project_env/bin/activate
```
✅ **You’ll see `(my_project_env)` in your terminal, meaning it's activated.**  

---

## **✅ Step 3: Install `requests` Library**  
Now that the environment is active, install `requests`:  
```sh
pip install requests
```
Check if it installed correctly:  
```sh
pip list
```
You should see `requests` in the list.  

---

## **✅ Step 4: Write a Python Script to Fetch Data from an API**  
Now, create a Python script 📄 **fetch_data.py** in your project folder.  

```python
import requests

# API URL (Example: Fetch random dog image)
url = "https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random"

# Sending request
response = requests.get(url)

# Checking if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()  # Convert response to JSON
    print("Random Dog Image:", data["message"])
else:
    print("Failed to fetch data")
```

✅ Run the script:  
```sh
python fetch_data.py
```
👉 You should see a **random dog image URL** printed. 🎉  

---

## **✅ Step 5: Deactivate the Virtual Environment**  
Exit the virtual environment:  
```sh
deactivate
```
✅ Now, your terminal will return to normal (without `(my_project_env)`).  

---

## **✅ Step 6: Try Running the Script Again (Outside the Virtual Environment)**  
Now, run:  
```sh
python fetch_data.py
```
❌ **You'll likely get an error:**  
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'
```
👉 This happens because `requests` was installed **only inside the virtual environment**!  

---

## **🎯 Summary**  

| **Command** | **Purpose** |
|------------|------------|
| `python -m venv my_project_env` | Create a virtual environment |
| `source my_project_env/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) <br> `my_project_env\Scripts\activate` (Windows) | Activate the virtual environment |
| `pip install requests` | Install requests inside the virtual environment |
| `python fetch_data.py` | Run the script (works inside the virtual environment) |
| `deactivate` | Exit the virtual environment |
| `python fetch_data.py` (outside) | ❌ Fails, because `requests` is not installed globally |

# You're setting up a **Python virtual environment** and installing `boto3` inside it. Let’s break it down step by step.  

---

### **📌 Step-by-Step Explanation**

### **1️⃣ `pip install virtualenv`**  
🔹 Installs the `virtualenv` package globally (optional, as `venv` is built into Python 3).  
📌 **Note:** You can use Python's built-in `venv`, so this step is not always needed.

---

### **2️⃣ `python -m venv project-abc`**  
🔹 Creates a **virtual environment** named `project-abc`.  
✅ **What happens?**  
- A new folder **`project-abc/`** is created.  
- This folder contains a self-contained Python environment (with its own Python binary and `pip`).  
- It keeps dependencies separate from your system-wide Python installation.  

---

### **3️⃣ `source project-abc/bin/activate`** *(For macOS/Linux)*  
📌 **For Windows, use:**  
```sh
project-abc\Scripts\activate
```
🔹 Activates the virtual environment.  
✅ **What happens?**  
- Your terminal prompt will change to **`(project-abc)`** (indicating that the environment is active).  
- Any `pip install` command now installs packages **only inside this environment**, not globally.  

---

### **4️⃣ `pip install boto3`**  
🔹 Installs **Boto3** (AWS SDK for Python) inside `project-abc`.  
✅ **What happens?**  
- `boto3` gets installed **only inside `project-abc`** and not globally.  
- Running `pip list` will show `boto3` installed inside this environment.  

---

### **5️⃣ `deactivate`**  
🔹 Exits the virtual environment.  
✅ **What happens?**  
- Your terminal **returns to normal** (no more `(project-abc)` in the prompt).  
- Running Python outside this environment will **not** have access to `boto3` unless it’s installed globally.  

---

### **🎯 Summary**
| **Command** | **Purpose** |
|------------|------------|
| `pip install virtualenv` | (Optional) Installs virtualenv globally |
| `python -m venv project-abc` | Creates a virtual environment `project-abc` |
| `source project-abc/bin/activate` | Activates `project-abc` (Windows: `project-abc\Scripts\activate`) |
| `pip install boto3` | Installs `boto3` inside the virtual environment |
| `deactivate` | Exits the virtual environment |

---

### **🛠 Try This Next!**
1️⃣ Run `pip list` before and after activating `project-abc` to see the difference.  
2️⃣ Inside the environment, run:  
   ```sh
   python -c "import boto3; print(boto3.__version__)"
   ```
   ✅ If this prints a version number, `boto3` was installed correctly!  
3️⃣ Try running the same command **after `deactivate`**—it should fail unless `boto3` is installed globally.
